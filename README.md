# Near-Earth-Magnetospheric-Field-Model-of-the-Inner-Magnetosphere
Contains scripts to compute the external and internal  potential fields using the model of hourly variations of the near-Earth magnetic field generated in the inner magnetosphere and its induced counterpart described in Fillion et al. (2023).  The provided scripts show an example on how the model should be used.
